## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: How do I remove the auto-link for a specific keyword?**  
A: Go to the keyword management page, find the corresponding keyword, and delete it.

**Q: Why are some keywords not being auto-linked?**  
A: Possible reasons include:
- The post is excluded from auto-linking
- The post has already reached the maximum number of allowed links
- The keyword appears inside HTML tags, code blocks, or other protected content areas
